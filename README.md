# Delhi-Weather-Prediction
### Goal
The goal of the project is to predict future weather values (specifically temperature) in Delhi using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. This involves training the model on historical weather data to capture patterns and dependencies, allowing it to generate accurate forecasts for upcoming days

### Dataset 
[Delhi Weather Dataset](delhi_weather.csv)

### Library used 
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the actual and predicted weather data.

### Output
The output consists of predicted future weather values for Delhi, visualized as a time series graph. The graph compares actual historical weather data with the predicted values, showing the accuracy and effectiveness of the LSTM model in capturing weather patterns and trends.
